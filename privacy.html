        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2 class="subheading">Website Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we’re starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world.</p>
    
        <p>It’s important to Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer. We believe your business is no one else’s. Your privacy is important to you… and to us. So we’ll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd follows different principles in accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>
    
        <p>We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any other information to anyone. We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.</p>
    
        <h2 class="subheading">NOTICE</h2>
        <p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site or when you download free software, enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access premium site.</p>
    
        <p>We use your personal information for four primary purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
          <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
          <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
          <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered customers information about their products and services, using postal mail only.</p>
    
        <h2 class="subheading">ACCESS</h2>
        <p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at the My Details section. There, you can:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>View and edit personal information you have already given us</li>
          <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products</li>
          <li>Register. Once you register, you won’t need to do it again. Wherever you go on <a href="https://www.antislip.com.au">https://www.antislip.com.au</a>, your information stays with you.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="subheading">NOTICE TO PARENTS</h2>
        <p>Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children’s privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of their personal information while using the Internet.</p>
    
        <h2 class="subheading">ENFORCEMENT</h2>
        <p>If for some reason you believe Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd has not adhered to these principles, please contact us, and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.</p>
    
        <h2 class="subheading">CUSTOMER PROFILES</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>
    
        <p>When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across https://www.antislip.com.au/, allowing you to download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium sites without having to fill out registration forms with information you’ve already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won’t have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</p>
    
        <h2 class="subheading">WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h2>
        <p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer.</p>
    
        <p>When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case you want to order from us again, but we don’t use this information again without your permission.</p>
    
        <p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
    
        <p>Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Anti Slip Floor Safety Pty Ltd, its Websites, or the public.</p>
